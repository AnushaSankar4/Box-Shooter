# Box-Shooter
A Unity3d project 

A 3d game developed on Unity aimed at gaining the maximum number of game points by shooting the right coloured boxes. 
The game consists of two levels each of which involves reaching a mimimum score before the timer runs out.

This project was built as part of the course Beginner Game Development by Michigan State University on Coursera.
